# fincash
Fin Cash is a new algorithm-based stablecoin project on the HECO chain, and its core idea is derived from the design of basis.cash. Fin Cash improves the algorithm when the stablecoin is less than $1 by introducing two new mechanisms : Transaction Fee and Arbitrage Pool, so that the price of the stablecoin can be more closely anchored to the US dollar.
